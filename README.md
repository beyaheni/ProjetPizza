  <strong>Because pizza is more than food — it’s an emotion, a community, and a lifestyle.</strong>
</p>

<p align="center">
  <em>Pizza Restaurant</em> is designed to be simple, fast, and fun.  
  Built using the modern <strong>Vue.js</strong> framework, it offers a smooth, responsive interface  
  and an attractive layout that adapts perfectly to any device — from mobile to desktop.  
  The current version uses <strong>fake JSON data</strong> to simulate restaurant and pizza listings,  
  but will soon connect to a real database (SQL) for live content and user submissions.
</p>

<p align="center">
  Beyond being a website, our project is also an invitation to share your creativity.  
  Each user can contribute to the ever-growing catalog of pizzas,  
  helping us build a living, evolving community united by flavor and innovation.
